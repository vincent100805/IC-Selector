 IC Selector â€“ C Programming Project

This project is a simple C program that assists electronics designers in selecting the most suitable 74-series ICs based on specific circuit requirements.

- Let users input the type of circuit (FlipFlop, Gate, Decoder, Counter)
- Suggests matching ICs from a built-in database (e.g., 74LS74, 74HC00, 74LS138)
- Uses C structs and string matching to filter results
